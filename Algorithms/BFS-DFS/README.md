# Graph Traversal Algorithms
## BFS(Breadth First Search) AND DFS(Depth First Search)


# BFS(Breadth First Search) 
It is a graph traversal algorithm which uses a queue.
It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory.

# DFS(Depth First Search
It is a graph traversal algorithm which uses a stack .
he algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
