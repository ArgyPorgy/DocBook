## What is SQL?
The full form of **SQL** is "Structured Query Language." <br>
During the 1960s, Donald Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed **SQL** at **IBM**. It is a Query Language used for maintaining data or databases. 
Because **SQL** is not a programming language like **Python** or **C++**, it cannot be used for complex programming; it can only be used with databases.

## Why we need SQL?
Database operations, such as inserting, editing, and deleting records, are performed using **SQL**. With **SQL**, you can handle a lot of data very easily, and it's also fast when compared with other data analysis programs like **Microsoft Excel**.

## What is MySQL?
**SQL** is not a database system, but it is a query language. **MySQL** is a database management system (**DBMS**) that uses **SQL**. In Simple words, **MySQL** is software that works with "**Structured Query Language**". The **Oracle Corporation** developed **MySQL** and it is open-source (free for everyone to use).
